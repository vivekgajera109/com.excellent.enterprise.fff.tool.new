          "🔥 Tips for Participating in Events:\n"
          "1️⃣ Check the Events Tab:\n"
          "   - Open the Events tab in the main menu frequently.\n"
          "   - This section shows all ongoing and upcoming events with their requirements and rewards.\n"
          "   - Staying updated ensures you never miss valuable opportunities.\n\n"
          "2️⃣ Complete Event Tasks:\n"
          "   - Each event includes unique missions such as surviving a certain time, dealing damage, or winning matches.\n"
          "   - Completing all event tasks maximizes your reward potential.\n\n"
          "3️⃣ Participate in Limited-Time Events:\n"
          "   - Some events run only for a short duration (e.g., weekend specials, seasonal fests).\n"
          "   - Join them as soon as they launch to claim the best possible rewards before they expire.\n\n"
          "4️⃣ Use Event-Specific Items:\n"
          "   - Certain events reward you with unique items that can only be used during the event (e.g., tokens, exchange coins).\n"
          "   - Always utilize these items within the event period to unlock exclusive skins, characters, or vouchers.\n\n"
          "✅ Pro Tip: Combine daily missions with event challenges to progress faster. Many tasks overlap, so playing smart helps you earn double rewards without extra effort.",
